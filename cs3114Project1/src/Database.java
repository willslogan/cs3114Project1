 * will be overloaded methods for if we are removing by name or by coordinates.
 * Many of these methods will simply call the appropriate version of the
 * SkipList method after some preparation.
 * 
 * Also note that the Database class will have a clearer role in Project2, 
 * where we will have two data structures. The Database class will then determine 
 * which command should be directed to which data structure.
